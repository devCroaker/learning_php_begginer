A quotation has been entered!
Again!
The English language was carefully, carefully cobbled together by three blind dudes and a German dictionary.
Never spend your money before you have it.
The only difference between a rut and a grave... is in their dimensions.
Get the facts, or the facts will get you. And when you get them, get them right, or they will get you wrong.
